### The accounting equation

    Assets = Capital + Liabilities

Assets = ပိုင်ဆိုင်မှု

Capital = အရင်းအနှီး

Liabilities = အကြွေး

    Assets =  Non-Current Assets + Current Assts

    Liabilities = Non-Current Liabilities + Current Liabilities

Current means within 1 year

Non-Current means more than 1 year

### Assets

A resource controlled by the entity as result of past events and from which economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.

    Non-Current Asset = Machinery, Motor Vehicle, Building, Land, Equipment, Furnitures

    Current Asset = Inventory, Trade Receivable, Cash, Banု

#### Liability

A Liability is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.

    Non-Current Liabilities = Long Term Loan

    Current-Liabilities = Bank Overdraft, Trade Payable, Short Term Loan

Equity (Capital)

Equity is the residual interset in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities.
